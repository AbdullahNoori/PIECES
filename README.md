PIECES
(Therapeutic After School Program)

PIECES is an evidenced-based, trauma-informed, culturally responsive Therapeutic After-School incentive Program that provides support and respite for youth and families in our community. 
The name “PIECES” was inspired by the 7 dimensions of wellness and focuses on the Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, Creative, Environmental, and Social aspects of our lives. These PIECES are essential for our overall health and well being. 
Goal  
Our goal is to create a safe and enriching space during those pivotal hours after school. We want families to find relief in knowing that their children and adolescents will be supported and cared for no matter their degree of need. 
Our experienced staff combined with Masters Level Clinicians will help provide the knowledge and assistance necessary to promote a safe, peaceful, and invigorating experience. 
Our program emphasizes choice and a system of voting to allow participants to co-create their experiences. Youth will also help form their own schedule based on their desires and needs and be given incentives and awards for obtaining their PIECES. 
The idea of this is to create a safe, fun and therapeutic environment for our many participants that don’t have the funds or resources to attend a reliable after-school program. The difference with this program is that it will be a more therapeutic environment in which the staff is made up of mostly mental health clinicians. 


Physical

The Physical piece includes: Basketball, Volleyball, Wiffle Ball, Soccer, Dance, Yoga/Tai Chi, Biking, Fitness classes, Hiking, and Labor.

The Intellectual piece includes: Education, Employment, Independent Living Skills, Computers, and Skilled Labor. 

Emotional 
The Emotional piece has to do with mental health support and guidance. Our Masters level clinicians will meet with participants and families for counseling and therapy sessions.
